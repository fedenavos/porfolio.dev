# Pelibry

Mobile application developed with the Flutter framework. The purpose of the application is to log the movies watched by the user and share their thoughts on them. One registers with their email, enters a username, and can then start interacting with the application.

## Features within the app

- User registration with email and password.
- Allows logging each movie watched.
- When adding a movie, all that needs to be done is to indicate: the name of the movie, a rating, and the day it was watched.
- Once the movie is saved, it will be displayed in a list ordered by the viewing date.
- The user can write reviews of the movies they've watched.
- The user's profile has two sections: the list of movies and the reviews they wrote about them.

In addition, the application allows viewing other users' movie profiles within the app. One can search for their friend's username and observe their list and their reviews.
